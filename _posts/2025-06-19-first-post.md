Hey there — I’m Jake Bergeron.

I decided to spin up this site as a place to share thoughts, tools, and personal projects around the things I live and breathe every day: **DevSecOps**, **Linux tinkering**, and the never-ending quest to automate away the boring stuff.

I spend my days solving problems as a Solutions Engineer in cybersecurity, and my nights elbow-deep in home lab experiments, Jiu-Jitsu mat burns, and fishing gear. This blog is where all that intersects — part notebook, part storytelling, and part resource hub.

### What to Expect Here

This space will grow with content like:

- Real-world DevSecOps workflows and demos  
- Vulnerability simulation and ASPM tools  
- GitLab, CI/CD, and automation tricks  
- Home lab setup deep dives  
- Mindset lessons from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu  
- Occasional espresso-fueled hot takes

If you're into hacking together tools, building clean pipelines, or just want to learn how to build cool things securely — welcome.

### Coming Soon

I’ll be sharing more about:

- My GitHub Pages + Jekyll setup (the one powering this site)
- Simulating realistic security findings with open-source tools
- How Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu makes me a better technologist

Thanks for reading — and if you ever want to nerd out or collaborate, [get in touch](/contact/).
