## üß∞ Introduction

I've always wanted a home lab that lets me break things safely, test automations, and simulate enterprise-grade DevSecOps pipelines --- without melting my daily rig. After exploring ESXi, Hyper-V, and KVM, I landed on **Proxmox VE**. Here's how I built a reliable, flexible home lab using Proxmox, off-the-shelf hardware, and a bit of YAML wizardry.

---

## üîß The Hardware Stack

Here's a breakdown of the components that make up the backbone of my home lab:

* **CPU**: Intel Xeon E5-2670 (8C/16T) - A solid workhorse for virtualization.
* **RAM**: 64GB ECC DDR3 - Essential for running multiple VMs reliably.
* **Boot Disk**: 1TB NVMe via PCIe adapter - Blazing fast boot and system responsiveness.
* **Storage Pool**: 2√ó2TB SATA SSDs (ZFS mirror) - For resilient and performant VM storage.
* **NIC**: Intel i350 Quad-Port - Provides plenty of network interfaces for various VLANs and bridges.

## üöÄ Installing Proxmox VE

Getting Proxmox up and running was straightforward:

### Step 1: Download & Install

1.  **Download** the latest Proxmox VE ISO from their official website.
2.  **Create a bootable USB** drive using a tool like Rufus.
3.  **Install** Proxmox, opting for a **ZFS RAID1** configuration on the 2√ó2TB SSDs for data integrity.

### Step 2: Post-Install Setup

After the initial installation, I ran these commands to ensure my system was updated and configured correctly, specifically disabling the enterprise repository and enabling the no-subscription one:

```bash
apt update && apt full-upgrade -y
sed -i 's/^deb/#deb/' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list
echo "deb [http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve](http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve) bookworm pve-no-subscription" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-no-subscription.list
apt update && apt upgrade -y

```

üåê Network Configuration
------------------------

Network setup is critical for any home lab. Below is an example of my `/etc/network/interfaces` file. This configuration sets up a **Linux bridge (vmbr0)**, which connects to my physical network interface (`eno1`) and allows VMs to communicate directly with my home network.

```
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eno1
iface eno1 inet manual

auto vmbr0
iface vmbr0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.10/24
    gateway 192.168.1.1
    bridge_ports eno1
    bridge_stp off
    bridge_fd 0

```

* * * * *

üì¶ VM Templates & Cloning
-------------------------

To rapidly deploy new virtual machines, I created a reusable Ubuntu template. This saves a lot of time by pre-configuring common settings.

First, I shut down the base VM (e.g., ID 100) and convert it into a template:

Bash

```
qm shutdown 100
qm template 100

```

Then, cloning a new VM from this template is quick and easy:

Bash

```
qm clone 100 201 --name dev-ubuntu --full
qm start 201

```

* * * * *

üîí Securing Access
------------------

Security is a top priority for my home lab. Here's how I secure access:

I set up **SSH key-based authentication** for SSH access:

Bash

```
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

Additionally, I took these steps:

-   **Disable root password login** via SSH.
-   **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** in the Proxmox GUI for an extra layer of protection.
-   Utilize **VLANs** or the built-in **Proxmox firewall** for network zone isolation, separating different lab environments.

* * * * *

üîÅ Backups and Snapshots
------------------------

Data protection is non-negotiable. I leverage ZFS snapshots for quick point-in-time recovery and `rclone` for offsite backups.

**ZFS Snapshot:** Taking a snapshot of a VM's disk is instantaneous with ZFS:

Bash

```
zfs snapshot rpool/data/vm-100-disk-0@snapshot1
zfs list -t snapshot

```

**Offsite backup with rclone:** For disaster recovery, I sync my backups to a remote location using `rclone`:

Bash

```
rclone sync /mnt/backups remote:proxmox-backups --backup-dir remote:archive/$(date +%F)

```

üß™ What I'm Running
-------------------

My home lab serves as a dynamic environment for various projects and learning endeavors. Here's a glimpse of what's currently running:

-   **GitLab CE** (for CI/CD pipelines, code hosting, and project management)
-   **Ubuntu VMs** (dedicated instances for Docker containers and Ansible control nodes)
-   **Security Tools**: Semgrep, Grype, Syft, Checkov (used for static application security testing, vulnerability scanning, and Infrastructure as Code security analysis)
-   **SIEM Stack**: Elasticsearch + Filebeat (for centralized log collection, analysis, and threat detection)
-   **Windows Server AD lab** (a virtual Active Directory environment for exploring enterprise IT concepts)
-   **Custom Vulnerability Simulator** (my own creation for hands-on penetration testing practice)

* * * * *

üìú Ansible Example
------------------

Ansible is my workhorse for automation, allowing me to define and manage my infrastructure declaratively. Here's a simple playbook that installs common development tools on my `dev_vms`:

YAML

```
- name: Install dev tools
  hosts: dev_vms
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install packages
      apt:
        name:
          - git
          - docker.io
          - curl
        state: present

```

* * * * *

üß± Terraform Example
--------------------

I use Terraform to provision and manage my virtual machines on Proxmox as infrastructure as code. This allows for consistent and repeatable deployments. Here's an example demonstrating how to define a new Ubuntu VM:

Terraform

```
provider "proxmox" {
  pm_api_url  = "[https://192.168.1.10:8006/api2/json](https://192.168.1.10:8006/api2/json)"
  pm_user     = "root@pam"
  pm_password = var.proxmox_password
}

resource "proxmox_vm_qemu" "ubuntu_vm" {
  name        = "tf-test"
  target_node = "proxmox"
  clone       = "ubuntu-template"
  cores       = 2
  memory      = 2048
  network {
    model  = "virtio"
    bridge = "vmbr0"
  }
}

```

* * * * *

üß≠ Next Steps
-------------

My home lab is a continuous work in progress. Here are some exciting future plans:

-   **Add HA node** to enable high availability and automatic failover for critical services.
-   **Set up shared NFS/iSCSI** storage for enabling live migration of VMs between Proxmox nodes.
-   **Scale GitLab runners dynamically** to efficiently handle varying CI/CD pipeline workloads.
-   **Expand the vulnerability simulation framework** to include more complex attack scenarios and defensive strategies.

* * * * *

üß† Final Thoughts
-----------------

Building and managing a home lab with **Proxmox** has proven to be incredibly powerful and practical. It provides a robust, flexible, and open-source foundation perfect for tinkering, training, and tearing things down without fear of breaking your production environment. Whether you're testing CI/CD pipelines, simulating real-world attacks, or just learning the ropes of virtualization and infrastructure, Proxmox is a rock-solid choice.
